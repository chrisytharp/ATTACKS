We know from our port scan, that the only other open port on this machine is an SSH login.
We're going to use this information to try and bruteforce the password of the SSH login for our user using Hydra.

Preparation
            keep a note of the information you gathered during
            the enumeration stage, to aid in the exploitation.

Hydra
      There is a wide array of customisability when it comes to using Hydra, and it allows for adaptive password attacks against of many different services, including SSH. 
      Hydra uses dictionary attacks primarily, Kali Linux & Parrot have many different wordlists in the "/usr/share/wordlists" directory.
      
      SecLists is a wider array of other wordlists that are extremely useful for all sorts of purposes, other than just password cracking. Example = subdomain enumeration


The syntax for the command we're going to use to find the passwords is this:

"hydra -t 16 -l [USERNAME] -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV [VICTIMip] ssh"

Let's break it down:
                    SECTION	                                FUNCTION
                ------------------                      -------------------------------------------------------------
                   hydra	                                Runs the hydra tool
                  -t 16                                   Number of parallel connections per target
                  -l [user]	                              Points to the user who's account you're trying to compromise
                  -P [path to dictionary]               	Points to the file containing the list of possible passwords
                  -vV                                     Sets verbose mode to very verbose, shows the login+pass combination for each attempt
                  [machine IP]	                          The IP address of the target machine
                  ssh / protocol	                        Sets the protocol
