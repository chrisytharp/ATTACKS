When you would begin attacking MySQL

MySQL is likely not going to be the first point of call when getting initial information about the server. You can, as we have in previous tasks, attempt to 
brute-force default account passwords if you really don't have any other information; however, in most CTF scenarios, this is unlikely to be the avenue you're 
meant to pursue.

The Scenario

Typically, you will have gained some initial credentials from enumerating other services that you can then use to enumerate and exploit the MySQL service. 
As this room focuses on exploiting and enumerating the network service, for the sake of the scenario, we're going to assume that you found the credentials: 
"root:password" while enumerating subdomains of a web server. After trying the login against SSH unsuccessfully, you decide to try it against MySQL.

Requirements

"sudo apt install default-mysql-client" Don't worry- this won't install the server package on your system- just the client.

METASPLOIT

Alternatives

This can also be done either manually or with a set of non-Metasploit tools such as nmap's mysql-enum script:
        https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-enum.html

ENUMERATION cont..        SCENERIO: We have found "root:password" 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1- Port scan to find what port is MySQL using
2- Double check we can manually connect to the MySQL server w/ "root:password" 
                        "mysql -h [IP] -u [username] -p" 
3- Launch Metasploit "msfconsole"
4- "search mysql_sql" module
5- "USE" mysql_sql && set "OPTIONS"
6- Change the "sql" option to "show databases". how many databases are returned?
