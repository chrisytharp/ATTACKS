ENUMERATING         TOOLS: Metasploit & smtp-user-enum
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enumerating Server Details
            Poorly configured/vulnerable mail servers can often provide an initial foothold into a network, but prior to launching an attack, we want to fingerprint 
            the server to make our targeting as precise as possible. We're going to use the "smtp_version" module in MetaSploit to do this. As its name implies, 
            it will scan a range of IP addresses and determine the version of any mail servers it encounters.

Enumerating Users from SMTP
            SMTP service has 2 internal cmds that allow the enumeration of users: VRFY (confirming the names of valid users) and EXPN (which reveals the actual address of
            userâ€™s aliases and lists of e-mail (mailing lists). Using these SMTP commands, we can reveal a list of valid users
            
            Can do manually, over a telnet connection- however Metasploit comes to the rescue again, providing a handy module appropriately called "smtp_enum" that will do
            the legwork for us! Using the module is a simple matter of feeding it a host or range of hosts to scan and a wordlist containing usernames to enumerate.

Requirements
           Updates/ Upgraded MetasploitIt "sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y"
           

Alternatives
           This enumeration technique will work for the majority of SMTP configurations; however, non-metasploit tools such as "smtp-user-enum" that work even better for
           enumerating OS-level user accounts on Solaris via the SMTP service. Enumeration is performed by inspecting the responses to VRFY, EXPN, and RCPT TO commands.
