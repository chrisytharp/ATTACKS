ENUMERATING NFS           (Exploiting below)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOOLs:
      NFS-common    NMAP


NFS-Common:   sudo apt install nfs-common
        It is important to have this package installed on any machine that uses NFS, either as client or server. 
        It includes programs such as: lockd, statd, showmount, nfsstat, gssd, idmapd and mount.nfs. 
        Primarily, we are concerned with "showmount" and "mount.nfs" as these are going to be most useful to us 
        when it comes to extracting information from the NFS share

NMAP:     -A -p-
        1st step see what ports avail

Mounting NFS shares:    sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock
        Your clientâ€™s system needs a directory where all the content shared by the host server in the export folder can be accessed. You can create
        this folder anywhere on your system. Once you've created this mount point, you can use the "mount" command to connect the NFS share to the mount 
        point on your machine like so:

Let's break this down
