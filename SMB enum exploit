Enum4Linux
          Enum4linux is a tool used to enumerate SMB shares on both Windows & Linux systems. It is basically 
          a wrapper around the tools in the Samba package and makes it easy to quickly extract information from 
          the target pertaining to SMB.

The syntax of Enum4Linux is nice and simple: "enum4linux [options] ip"

TAG            FUNCTION

-U             get userlist
-M             get machine list
-N             get namelist dump (different from -U and-M)
-S             get sharelist
-P             get password policy information
-G             get group and member list
-A             all of the above (full basic enumeration)

Types of SMB Exploit

          While there are vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-7494 that can allow remote code execution by exploiting
          SMB, you're more likely to encounter a situation where the best way into a system is due to misconfigurations 
          in the system. In this case, we're going to be exploiting anonymous SMB share access- a common misconfiguration 
          that can allow us to gain information that will lead to a shell.

Method Breakdown
                So, from our enumeration stage, we know:
                    - The SMB share location
                    - The name of an interesting SMB share
SMBClient

Because we're trying to access an SMB share, we need a client to access resources on servers. 
We will be using SMBClient because it's part of the default samba suite.

We can remotely access the SMB share using the syntax:

          smbclient //[IP]/[SHARE]

Followed by the tags:
-U [name] : to specify the user
-p [port] : to specify the port
