NTHash / NTLM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NThash is the hash format that modern Windows OS machines will store user and service passwords in
  Commonly referred to as "NTLM" which references the previous version of Windows format for hashing passwords known as "LM", thus "NT/LM".

  History, NT designation for Windows products meant "New Technology" & was used starting with Windows NT, to denote products that were not built up from the 
  MS-DOS Operating System. 
  Eventually, the "NT" line became the standard OS type to be released by Microsoft and the name was dropped, but it still lives on in the names of some 
  Microsoft technologies. 

Aquire NTHash/NTLM hashes by dumping the "SAM database" using a tool like Mimikatz OR from Active Directory database "NTDS.dit"
You may not have to crack the hash to continue privilege escalation as you can often conduct a "PASS-th-HASH" attack instead,
but sometimes hash cracking is a viable option if there is a weak password policy!
