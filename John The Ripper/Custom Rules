Custom Rules
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defining your own set of rules, which John will use to dynamically create passwords. Especially useful when you know more information about the password 
          structure of whatever your target is.
          
Common Custom Rules
-----------------------
Password complexity in Companies req:
      Capital letter
      Number
      Symbol

Ex..   Password1!

Creating Custom Rules
-----------------------
Custom rules are defined in the "john.conf" file located in /etc/john/john.conf
Syntax of these custom rules   More Info Here -> https://www.openwall.com/john/doc/RULES.shtml

  1st Line: [List.Rules:MyRule] - Is used to define the name of your rule, this is what you will use to call your custom rule as an argument.

  We then use a regex style pattern match to define where in the word will be modified NOTE: only covering the basics and most common modifiers:
        Az - Takes the word and appends it with the characters you define
        A0 - Takes the word and prepends it with the characters you define
        c - Capitalises the character positionally
These can be used in combination to define where and what in the word you want to modify.

Then define what characters should be appended, prepended or otherwise included, we do this by adding character sets in square brackets [ ]
in the order they should be used. These directly follow the modifier patterns inside of double quotes " ". Here are some common examples:
        [0-9] - Will include numbers 0-9
        [0] - Will include only the number 0
        [A-z] - Will include both upper and lowercase
        [A-Z] - Will include only uppercase letters
        [a-z] - Will include only lowercase letters
        [a] - Will include only a
        [!£$%@] - Will include the symbols !£$%@

Putting this all together, in order to generate a wordlist from the rules that would match the example password "Password1!" we would create 
a rule entry that looks like this:
        
        [List.Rules:MyRule]
        cAz"[0-9] [!£$%@]"

In order to:
        Capitalise the first  letter - c                     rule looks for passwords - 1st is CAPITALIZED, the length is 0-9 digits long (using all letters from A-Z & a-z)
        Append to the end of the word - Az                                              and ends with one of the following special chars "!£$%@"
        A number in the range 0-9 - [0-9]
        Followed by a symbol that is one of [!£$%@]



Using Custom Rules
We could then call this custom rule as a John argument using the  --rule=MyRule

        john --wordlist=[path to wordlist] --rule=PoloPassword [path to file]

Jumbo John comes with a large list of custom rules, which contain modifiers for use almost all cases. If you get stuck, try looking at those rules [around line 678] if your
syntax isn't working properly.
