C2 Server

Agents / Payloads
    Payload Types (Stageless & Staged)
    
        Stageless Payloads (Simplest) they contain the full C2 agent and will call back to the C2 server and begin beaconing immediately.
                                1. The Victim downloads and executes the Dropper
                                2. The beaconing to the C2 Server begins
                                
        Staged Payloads req a callback to the C2 server to download additional parts of the C2 agent. Referred to as a “Dropper” because it is “Dropped” onto the victim machine 
        to download the second stage of our staged payload. Preferred method because small amount of code needs to be written to retrieve the additional parts of the C2 agent 
        from the C2 server. It also makes it easier to obfuscate code to bypass Anti-Virus programs.
                                1. The Victim downloads and executes the "Dropper" 
                                2. The Dropper calls back to the C2 Server for Stage 2
                                3. The C2 Server sends Stage 2 back to the Victim Workstation
                                4. Stage 2 is loaded into memory on the Victim Workstation 
                                5. C2 Beaconing Initializes, and the Red Teamer/Threat Actors can engage with the Victim on the C2 Server.
